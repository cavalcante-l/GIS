>**Abstract**:   "Classification techniques in satellite images enable mapping land cover usage and quantification of area with rapidly time process using Google Earth Engine platform. Hence, this work aims to classify Tupãssi municipality, in Paraná State, Brazil, using Lansat-8/OLI images by the classifiers Cascade K-Means, Naïve Bayes and manual vectorization in GEE. Five targets were used: soybean, corn, water, forest and urban areas as input. The dominant target was soybean (85% of area), followed by 13%. The results shown that Cascade K-means algorithm achieve 87,86% of OA and Kappa 0,56, and Naïve Bayes with 88,59% of OA and Kappa 0,58."
